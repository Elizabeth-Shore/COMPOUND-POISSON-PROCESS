# COMPOUND-POISSON-PROCESS
This repository includes R code that models a compound Poisson process with exponential arrivals and exponential jumps. It generates histograms for different time values and provides a Shiny app to explore how changing parameters affects  𝑆 ( 𝑡 ). A simple and interactive way to understand compound processes.
